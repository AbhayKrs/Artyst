Artyst web is built upon the MERN stack framework along with [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) as the CSS framework, [Passport.js](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) as the authentication middleware and uses the [Multer GridFS](https://github.com/devconcept/multer-gridfs-storage) storage specification.

**Highlight features**:
 - Artyst Tagging and Classification Model is a image classification keras model built and used within the Artyst application to automate tagging and categorize uploads under a fixed number of labels. In addition, the model also categorizes adult content and enables a filter censoring of such content to younger users.
 - Artyst file storage is optimized using the GridFS storage engine to store files directly to MongoDB along with image compression to reduce file size load.
 - A token based reward system (not crypto) to enable greater enagagement and sustainable growth for the Artyst members.
